# War-game

## Introduction

  Developed a captivating web application war game utilizing
predominantly JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Designed an immersive gaming experience by implementing dynamic
visuals and interactive features. Demonstrated a strong passion for coding and game development
through the creation of this engaging project.

  This web app game initially shows the rules and asks for the user's name, updating it on another web page. On the gaming web page, users are provided with
attack and healing buttons to use against their opponent and themselves, respectively. It also updates the points for each attack and heal below. Lastly, it provides a reset button to restart the entire game. The best thing about this game is the additional audio it adds while attacking, healing, and announcing the winner.
